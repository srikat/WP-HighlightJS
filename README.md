2) Upload the entire `wp-highlightjs` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

Important: Make sure that the name of the plugin directory is `wp-highlightjs`. This is important for the clipboard icon to appear. You can check and make this change using a FTP client or cPanel's file manager.

## Usage ##

CSS:

Note: To prevent HTML from being parsed, escape angle brackets in your source with `&lt;` and `&gt;` in order to have them appear literally in the document.
